## NixOS Everywhere: WSL

### The Goal

In my quest to have a
low maintenance, use anywhere, perfectly reproducible baseline for all my systems,
I find myself resorting to NixOS.
It has the uniqe ability to leave it and come back months later and pick up where I left off without major suprises.

For this project the goal is simple. I want a single command script that will set up my:

 - Dev Environment
 - Communications
 - Secrets

and if applicable:

 - Platform Specific Shell
 - Application Configurations

on Windows, only compromized by security, performance, and support.
I've already achieved this on Linux, using [Disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko) + [NixOS Anywhere](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-anywhere) + [NixOS System Flakes](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-07-31-nixos-flakes/), but
it's time to take it to the next level by making the appropriate parts of the config
work in [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

### The Plan

This entire plan hinges on two projects, WSL and NixOS-WSL.
Integrating these two things together will not be easy, but first I need a way
to execute PS1 scripts from a Bash Script on windows.
The steps are:

 1. [Enable the Windows Features required for WSL](#enabling-wsl2-dependencies)
 2. Download the latest NixOS-WSL archive
 3. Install NixOS-WSL
 4. Initialize NixOS-WSL
 5. Copy keys with correct permissions into NixOS-WSL
 6. Create a `nix-shell` with git
 7. Clone the nixos config into NixOS-WSL
 8. Apply the NixOS Config

#### Enabling WSL2 Dependencies
Installing WSL2 is complicated by the need to enable Windows features.
Specifically, the ambiguously documented [Virtual Machine Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/) Windows feature.
Windows being Windows there exists a way to [enable this feature through the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/enable-or-disable-windows-features-using-dism?view=windows-11),
specifically:

> Dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:VirtualMachinePlatform /All

Perfect, now I can just wrap this in a script the requests elevation
and I'll have the first part done

The first step is simple. This command requires admin priviliges, so I'll need to
request an admin command prompt:

```ps1
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList '-Command', 'echo "Hello, World!"' -Verb RunAs
```

This will create an administractive shell that echos `Hello, World!`.
You can't see it, but it works!
